# Real-Time Editor Web Project Documentation

This is a web-based code editor that allows users to write HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code in separate text areas, and see the output in real-time on an embedded iframe. The project uses Split.js library to split the screen into two sections. On the left-hand side, there are three text areas for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code respectively. On the right-hand side, there is an embedded iframe where the user can see the output of the code.

## How to Use

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to launch the editor.
2. Write your HTML code in the "Type HTML code here" text area.
3. Write your CSS code in the "Type CSS code here" text area.
4. Write your JavaScript code in the "Type JavaScript code here" text area.
5. The output will be automatically displayed in the embedded iframe on the right side of the screen.
